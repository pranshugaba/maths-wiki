It helps us answer questions like \"How many ways to arrange books on a shelf?\" and \"How many ways to write 42 as a sum of three numbers?\". Knowing how to count is useful while designing algorithms. It has applications in probability and statistics, as well as graph theory. In this section, we will begin with elementary counting methods like pigeon-hole principle, and rules of sum and product. We will then look at the binomial theorem, Pascal's triangle, and more advanced methods like generating functions.","title":"Combinatorics Overview"},{"location":"combinatorics/introduction/#combinatorics-overview","text":"Combinatorics is about how to count.

Theorem If there are n n holes, and n+1 n+1 pigeons, and each pigeon is in some hole, then there exists a hole with at least two pigeons. Proof Suppose all holes have at most one pigeon. Then there are at most n n pigeons. This is a contradiction since we have n+1 n+1 pigeons. Generalized PHP \u00b6 Theorem If there are n n holes, and rn+1 rn+1 pigeons, and each pigeon is in some hole, then there exists a hole with at least r+1 r+1 pigeons. The proof is left as an exercise to the reader. Exercises \u00b6 Question Nine numbers are selected from the set \\{1, 2, \\ldots , 100 \\} \\{1, 2, \\ldots , 100 \\} .

A probability space is a triple \((\Omega, \mathcal{F}, P)\). 

The set \(\Omega\) is the sample space. It consists of all possible outcomes. 
An event \(E\) is a subset of \(\Omega\). 
\(\mathcal{F}\) is the set of events. 
\(P\) is the probability function that assigns to each event in \(\mathcal{F}\) a value between \(0\) and \(1\).

## Complex numbers
What are the solutions of $x^2 + 1 = 0$? There is no real value of $x$ for which this equation holds true. Extending to complex numbers solves this problem. 

### Definitions

Every complex number is equivalent to an ordered pair of real numbers. $(a, b)$ which follows certain rules. In fact, they form a field. 

- Addition    
  $(a, b) + (c, d) = (a + b, c + d)$
- Multiplication   
  $(a, b) \cdot (c, d) = (ac + bd, ad - bc)$

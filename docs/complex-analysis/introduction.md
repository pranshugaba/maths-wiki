# Overview

What are the solutions of $x^2 + 1 = 0$? There is no real value of $x$ for which this equation holds true. Extending to complex numbers solves this problem. 

In this book, we will look at complex numbers, functions on the complex plane. In particular, we will study the properties of holomorphic functions.

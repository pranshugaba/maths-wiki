# Overview

## Structure of the book
We begin with elementary counting methods such as rules of sum and product, the pigeonhole principle, and the principle of inclusion and exclusion. 

We then move on to binomial coefficients and their properties. 

Finally, we look at some advanced techniques such as recurrences, generating functions, and Burnside's lemma. 

## Prerequisites
Basic knowledge of [set theory](appendix/set-theory) is recommended.
Reading the [appendix](appendix/set-theory) on set theory should be sufficient.
Exposure to group theory is helpful, but not necessary. 
There are no other prerequisites for this book.

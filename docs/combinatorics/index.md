# Overview

## Structure of the book
We begin with elementary counting methods such as rules of sum and product, the pigeonhole principle, and the principle of inclusion and exclusion. 

We then move on to binomial coefficients and their properties. 

Finally, we look at some advanced techniques such as recurrences, generating functions, and Burnside's lemma. 

## Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for this book. Basic knowledge of [set theory](appendix/set-theory) is recommended. Exposure to group theory is helpful, but not necessary.

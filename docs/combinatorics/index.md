# Overview

Combinatorics is about how to count. It helps us answer questions like "How many ways to arrange books on a shelf?" and "How many ways to write 42 as a sum of three numbers?". 

Knowing how to count is useful while designing algorithms. It has applications in probability and statistics, as well as graph theory.

In this section, we will begin with elementary counting methods like pigeon-hole principle, and rules of sum and product. We will then look at the binomial theorem, Pascal's triangle, and more advanced methods like generating functions.

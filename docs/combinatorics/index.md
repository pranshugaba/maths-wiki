# Overview

Combinatorics is all about counting. It helps us answer questions such as "In how many different ways can you arrange 10 books on a shelf?" and "In how many ways can you write 42 as a sum of three positive numbers?". 

Knowing how to count is useful while designing algorithms. It has applications in probability and statistics, as well as graph theory.

We will begin with elementary counting methods like the pigeon-hole principle, and rules of sum and product. We will then look at the binomial theorem, Pascal's triangle, and more advanced methods like generating functions.

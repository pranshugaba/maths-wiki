# Overview

Combinatorics is all about counting. It helps us answer questions such as "In how many different ways can you arrange 10 books on a shelf?" and "In how many ways can you write 42 as a sum of three positive numbers?". 

Knowing how to count is useful while designing algorithms. It has applications in probability and statistics, as well as graph theory.

# Introduction

Combinatorics is the area of mathematics that deals with the art of counting. 

Humans have been counting since the stone age. 
Most people learn how to count at a very young age. 
However, this doesn't mean you should discount this subject as easy or trivial. 
There are a lot of challenging and interesting problems in combinatorics, many of which are still open. 
There has been great progress in this field in the last half-century and it is still a site of active research. 

Knowing how to count it is a useful skill. 
It has applications in a wide variety of fields ranging from designing algorithms to calculating probabilities to statistical thermodynamics and more. 
Combinatorics involves asking questions such as 

- In how many ways can you arrange 10 books on a shelf?
- In how many ways can you write 42 as a sum of three positive numbers?
- How many different configurations does a Rubik's cube have?

In this book, we will develop techniques that will help us count better and answer such questions.

#Groups

A _group_ \((G, *)\) consists of a set \(G\) and a binary operation \(*\) such that

- \(G\) is closed under \(*\)  
This means that if \(g*h\) belongs to \(G\) for all \(g, h \in G\).
- Associativity  
This implies that \(g_1 * (g_2 * g_3) = (g_1 * g_2) * g_3\) for all \(g_1, g_2, g_3 \in G\).
- There exists an identity element  
There exists an element \(1\) such that \(g * 1 = 1 * g = g\) for all \(g \in G\).
- Every element has an inverse.  
For every element \(g \in G\), there exists an element \(h\) such that \(gh = hg = 1\).

Some examples of groups are \((\mathbb{Z}, +)\), \((\mathbb{Z}_0, \times)\).

If the group operation is commutative, then we say the group is _abelian_.

The _order of the group_ is the number of elements in the group. \(|G|\).

The _order of an element_ \(g\) is the minimum integer \(n\) such that \(g^n = 1\).

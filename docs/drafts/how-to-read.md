# How to read this wiki

It is helpful to read the wiki. Effort has been put in to make the content accessible and friendly. Read at your own pace, try to understand the concepts thoroughly before moving on. Take regular breaks. But also read regularly. 

Try proving theorems on your own before reading the proofs. The proofs are collapsed by default for this reason. Hints are present in case of a difficult proof.

Same for problems and solutions. Try to solve them on your own before reading the solutions.
